//! Safe scalar codec kernels for FrankenGraphDB.
//!
//! The registry-independent layer contains canonical unsigned LEB128 and
//! delta-varint, checked bitpacking/frame-of-reference and Elias-Fano kernels,
//! deterministic block compression, roaring-style sets, the honest closed
//! neighbor-codec family, type-safe identity-column mechanics, scalar dispatch
//! traits, and structured diagnostic evidence. Durable codec identifiers,
//! envelopes, logical-digest recipes, and SIMD implementations remain owned by
//! their still-gated format and unsafe-boundary work.
